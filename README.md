# Python 
#### Version 1.0.0

Hey!!!  
Welcome to Python, a multi-use interpreted programming language. This course is a little side project intended to teach you Python in a simple, self-paced, well-laid-out manner. To be completely honest I have no idea how long this will take to learn, but I believe it should probably only take about 5-10 minutes to complete each topic.  
  
If you enjoy this course please let me know!  
    Thanks, Jake ðŸ‘‹
